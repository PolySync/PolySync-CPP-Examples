## LiDAR Translator

This example is a generalized LiDAR message translator for messages coming from PolySync into ROS via the PolySync ROS bridge. It is generalized to work with any LiDAR driver or application running in PolySync. 

Each PointCloud2 message will contain the source GUID of the driver sending the `ps_lidar_points_msg` in its frame_id field. Thus, you can differentiate the incoming data as necessary. Similarly, the PolySync timestamp is copied over to the native PointCloud2 messages. 

The transform for each incoming message of a particular GUID can be manually modified to match what is in the PolySync SDF. This allows simple sensor translation so that the data is correctly kept relative to the vehicles center frame, as in PolySync. 

It would be easy to adapt this example to publish data in the other direction. This example could be adapted to republish `ps_radar_targets_msg` to PointCloud2, allowing you to use all RADAR drivers in PolySync with ROS. This example is intended to be very easy to use while still being powerful in its potential applications.

### Building and running the example

To properly build this example with the generated PolySync messages in ROS, you will first need to set up your catkin workspace with the ros_bridge.

If you do not have a catkin workspace already, follow these steps to set one up.

http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace

If you do have a workspace, feel free to continue with the steps below. First source your ROS install, and then create a package in the src directory of your catkin workspace, as shown below.

```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
$ catkin_create_pkg polysync_lidar_translator std_msgs roscpp tf
```

Copy "polysync_lidar_translator_node.cpp" to the src directory of the polysync_lidar_translator package you created.

```bash
$ cp PolySync-Core-CPP-Examples/PolysyncLidarTranslator/polysync_lidar_translator_node.cpp ~/catkin_ws/src/polysync_lidar_translator/src/
```

Make sure that in the "Build" section of the CMakeLists file for your PolysyncLidarTranslator project are uncommented. All other lines in the "Build" section should be commented.

```bash
## Declare a C++ executable
add_executable(polysync_lidar_translator_node src/polysync_lidar_translator_node.cpp)

## Add cmake target dependencies of the executable
## same as for the library above
add_dependencies(polysync_lidar_translator_node ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})

## Specify libraries to link a library or executable target against
target_link_libraries(polysync_lidar_translator_node
   ${catkin_LIBRARIES}
 )
```

Generate the ros_bridge files in the src folder of your catkin workspace, and copy the ros_bridge project into the root directory of your catkin workspace, as shown below.

```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ pdm-gen -r -c /usr/local/polysync/modules/sensor/sensor.idl /usr/local/polysync/modules/navigation/navigation.idl /usr/local/polysync/modules/control/control.idl /usr/local/polysync/modules/dtc/dtc.idl
$ mv pdm/ros_bridge ../
$ rm -rf pdm
```

Source the ros_bridge, and then run catkin_make in the root directory of your catkin workspace.

```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source ros_bridge/setup.bash
$ catkin_make
```

Run ROS bridge node as shown below, remembering to source ros_bridge/setup.bash if using a different terminal.

```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/ros_bridge/share/polysync_ros_bridge
$ ./BridgeNode -t ps_lidar_points_msg
```

Start up PolySync data generator in another terminal.

```bash
$ polysync-data-generator-c
```

Run the translator project you just built. The executable should be in the devel folder of your catkin workspace.

```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/polysync_lidar_translator
$ ./polysync_lidar_translator_node
```

Open up rviz.

```bash
$ rosrun rviz rviz
```

In "Global Options" for the fixed frame select "world," then hit "add" and add a new "PointCloud2" visualization. For the topic of this new visualization select "/polysync/lidar_points." You can change the style to "Points" to have a little more realistic looking LiDAR point cloud.
