/**
 * \example SharedMemoryImageDataViewer.cpp
 *
 * PolySync Sample C++ API example
 *      Demonstrate access to shared memory written to by a video device driver.
 *
 * In order to compile and run:
 *
 * 1.) Example requires PolySync Lochsa (v2.0) or later.
 *
 * 2.) Make sure to set up a video device using the polysync-sdf-configurator
 *     tool.
 *
 * 3.) In the SDF configurator, under "IO Configuration" for the device, set
 *     "Shared Memory Output Queue Key to a unique key that you will input to
 *     this example.
 *
 * 4.) Run your device driver. "polysync-dynamic-driver -n 1 -o" Assuming your driver's
 *     identifier is 1 in the system design file.
 *
 * 5.) To build this example, starting in it's directory:
 *     1 - mkdir build && cd build
 *     2 - cmake ..
 *     3 - make ..
 *
 * 6.) Run the example:
 *     1 - ./polysync-shdmem-image-data-viewer-cpp
