### Echo

This example illustrates a common process for implementing perception algorithms, and using logfile data as an algorithm development acceleration tool.

See the [Ground Plane Detection Tutorial](https://help.polysync.io/articles/tutorials-and-examples/tutorials/ground-plane-detection-tutorial/) for a detailed description.

### Dependencies

Packages: libglib2.0-dev

To install on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install <package>
```

### Building and running the node

```bash
$ cd Echo 
$ mkdir build && cd build
