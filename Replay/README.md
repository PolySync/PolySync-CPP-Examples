### Replay

Replay is more of a tool than an example. It exposes much of the functionality of the ReplaySession API as a command line tool.
This is an interactive application, which expects you to enter the replay session ID and allows you to stop the replay.
As an example, this code illustrates how to properly access the RecordSession APIs functionality.

### Dependencies

Packages: libglib2.0-dev

To install on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
```

### Building and running the node

```bash
$ cd Replay 
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./polysync-replay-cpp
```
